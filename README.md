# Project: Medical Classification using CNN

## Contents
This repository includes:
- `Projet_Medical_Classification.ipynb` : Main Jupyter notebook
- `CNN_model_SL.keras` & `CNN_model.keras` : Trained models (with or without early stopping)
- `historySL.pkl` & `history.pkl` : Training history (with or without early stopping)

## Data
